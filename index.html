    <p>
        About HTML/CSS, since my work related to building webpages, so i would love to understand more and more about CSS.
    </p>    
    <p>
        For javascript, I would love to try creating a plugin for my own, about styling table, date picker, anything related to transform a simple element into something more.
    </p>    
    <p>
        I have taken interest in Progressive Web Application, along with .NET Core, so it would be perfect if i could learn more or join some work related to these techs.
